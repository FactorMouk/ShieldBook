# ShieldBook
A WEB system for creating, editing and sharing virtual master shields.

Shieldbook is an open source project which
has as its main philosophy the possibility of any
and all 5D & D masters to have easy and free
access to their shields and notes.

It was initially planned by two students of Computer
Science at the Federal University of Pernambuco
(UFPE) and has been receiving updates from
community suggestions, especially on the GitHub platform.

What we most want is that more and more
masters use our system and share their work
among them, increasing and strengthening this rich
community of RPG players!

And most important, ALWAYS FOR FREE!
